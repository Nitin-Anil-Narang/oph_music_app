            Artist Portal and Services <br>
            An artist portal allows artists to edit their profiles and services by their own accounts. An artist, who registers, agrees to:
 <br>

<ul>
    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        Registration Process

    </li>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        Artists will be required to provide valid personal details and supporting documents, such as an Aadhar card, bio, signature,
and bank account details, for verification. After successful verification, an account will be generated. Registration is done after
taking consent for the use of Aadhar for verification under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016.


    </p>
    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        Song Submission

    </li>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        Artists can submit their songs through two project patterns: <br>
        New Project Pattern: Songs that have never been uploaded elsewhere can be released solely on the OPH platform. The
        copyright will belong to the artist, but he or she will assign rights to OPH to upload and publish the song. The revenue will be
        paid directly to the artist. <br>
        Hybrid Project Pattern: Songs already released elsewhere can be uploaded to OPH. The artist owns the copyright but gives
        OPH permission to upload and distribute the song. Artists cannot file copyright infringement against OPH. The money
        generated from the song will be paid directly to the artist. These terms comply with the Copyright Act, 1957.


    </p>
    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        Revenue and Payment Terms
    </li>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        Artists will receive their money from the song submission within 10-15 days of the withdrawal request. The Indian Contract
Act, 1872, does not refund event participation fees, membership payments, and song registration fees.

    </p>
    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        Content and Copyright
    </li>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        By submitting content, the artist hereby declares that the content is original and that he grants OPH the right to upload and
distribute the content. The artist undertakes not to sue OPH for any legal remedy for the uploaded content as contemplated
under the Copyright Act, 1957.

    </p>
    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        Responsibilities of Artist

    </li>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        Artists must abide by the services offered by the Platform. Artists shall not request changes or dictate terms relating to the
        services of the Platform. OPH may modify its pricing or services at any time, subject to Section 37 of the Indian Contract Act,
        1872.

    </li>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        Artists are liable to pay non-refundable participation fees for events. Rewards from events will be processed offline, and
artists will provide the necessary details for disbursement as required by Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

    </p>
    <li style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        Limitation of Liability

    </li>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: left; color: black;">
        OPH is not responsible or liable for any damage, loss, or dispute arising out of the use of the Platform. Artists agree to
indemnify OPH from all claims connected with the uploading of content, ranking, or distribution of revenue under Section 73
of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
